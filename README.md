This TripleA map was developed with pride by Elreigh between April 9 and May 7, 2018. 

The scenario is based on a nations role-play game that I ran with a few friends of mine in early 2018. 

Thanks to CrowTheMagician, Dean, Olors, Pon3, Roarshack, SgtDornan, Stoffe, Taryn, Triangle, and Xia for helping to create the game world. 

Unit sprites are borrowed from Fairline on the civfanatics forum. 

Building sprites were constructed from generic clip art or borrowed from Rise of Nations. 

National emblems are all my own creations, except for the Indian, Korean, Chinese, and Arcadian emblems, which are borrowed from existing real-world symbols. 

Territory Effects (terrain) images are borrowed from Total World War, a TripleA scenario by Rolf Larsson and Hepster.

Base map and relief map created by Elreigh in Paint.NET. 

All coding done by Elreigh in notepad with advice from the TripleA forums.
