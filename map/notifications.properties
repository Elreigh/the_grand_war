totalWarNotification = The enemy has us backed into a corner, and we<br>are now forced to fully mobilize our economy<br>for total war. From now on our income will be<br>amplified by +1PU per territory.

capturedBombNotification = The recent capture of enemy science facilities<br>has provided us with insight into the secrets of<br>nuclear fission. We have sent a science team to<br>study the enemy's discoveries, and soon we will<br>be able to produce nuclear weapons of our own.

theBombNotification = Our nuclear science team has successfully tested<br>an atomic bomb prototype in a remote part of<br>the country. We are now ready to produce this<br>weapon for the war effort.<br><br>(Can now build Nuclear Facilities and Nukes)

nuclearReactorNotification = Our scientists have created a functioning nuclear<br>reactor, a proof of concept for new nuclear fuels<br>which can power our atomic weapons once we<br>build them.<br><br>(Received 8 uranium and 3 techTokens)

depletedUraniumNotification = Radiological testing and production has a byproduct:<br>the non-radioactive depleted uranium. It is an<br>incredibly dense metal, making it a perfect material<br>for anti-tank munitions.<br><br>(Tanks give -1atk/-1def to enemy tanks)

rocketInterceptorNotification = Our aviation department has put recent developments in<br>rocketry to use in the development of a rocket-powered<br>interceptor, a cheap yet powerful short range fighter<br>that excells at defense.<br><br>(Can now build Rocket Interceptors)

rocketArtilleryNotification = Although rocket artillery has been around for centuries,<br>it has never been precise or very powerful, nor has it<br>been produced at an industrial scale... until now. Our new<br>and perfected rocket artillery provides cheap tactical<br>support to multiple infantry units simultaneously.<br><br>(Can now build Rocket Artillery)

rocketNotification = We have invented a radar guidance system for our largest missiles,<br>allowing us to construct Short Range Ballistic Missiles which<br>deliver bombing payloads to their targets without a pilot, and<br>without the risk of interception. The unfortunate yet obvious<br>limitation is that we can only strike stationary targets, and each<br>weapon has only a single use.<br><br>(Can now build Rockets)

syntheticsNotification = Developments in chemistry have made it possible to<br>fabricate our own synthetic fuel, and use oil more<br>efficiently in the production of plastics and other<br>petroleum products.<br><br>(Can now exchange oil and PUs)

salvageNotification = Our industries have been retooled to make due with<br>recycled materials and our arms have been standardized<br>to use foreign munitions.<br><br>(Repair cost lowered by 50%, gain 2PUs each time you<br>destroy 5PUs worth of enemy units in a single round;<br>you can gain a maximum of 10PUs per round in this way)

digitalComputerNotification = Electromechanical computers have greatly aided the<br>war effort in a variety of ways. Now we have a fully<br>electronic digital computer, with greater computational<br>speeds than ever before.<br><br>(Can now exchange tech and PUs)

sonarNotification = Advances in sonar technology has given our destroyers<br>enhanced capabilities against enemy submarines.<br><br>(Destroyers give -1atk/-1def to enemy submarines)

electricEngineNotification = The electric engine allows our submarines to stay<br>submerged for much longer amounts of time, giving<br>them an even greater element of surprise.<br><br>(Submarines receive +1atk/+2def)

auxiliaryConvoysNotification = One of the great challenges of naval campaigns is maintaining<br>a steady supply of food, fuel, and munitions for our ships.<br>Logistics has traditionally been provided through stockpiles<br>at friendly ports, but with recent advances in ship defense<br>we can instead move supplies to our warships by way of secure<br>convoys, allowing the fleet to operate farther overseas.<br><br>(All naval ships receive +1 movement)

flakHalftrackNotification = The proximity fuse is a device afixed to the cap of a flak<br>canister or artillery shell that causes the munition to<br>explode when it reaches a certain distance from its target.<br>This revolutionary invention will make it much easier for<br>flak cannons to target air units.<br><br>(Can now build Flak Halftrack unit and carriers/battleships<br>receive +2AA defense)

radarNotification = Radar allows us to detect the movement of distant<br>enemy aircraft, giving our fighters better response<br>time against bombing raids and our bombers a safer<br>path to reach their targets.<br><br>(Air units receive +1atk/+1def for air battles,<br>infrastructure gains +1AA defense)

seismicBombNotification = Bombers often have difficulty in targetting industrial<br>infrastructure like bridges and pipelines or military<br>fortifications like walls and entrenchments because a<br>direct hit is necessary to cause much, if any damage.<br>The so-called "Earthquake Bomb" solves this issue by<br>penetrating deep underground instead of exploding on<br>the surface, providing enough concussive force to the<br>foundations that the target is shaken, rather than<br>blasted, apart.<br><br>(Bombers receive +3 strategic bombing bonus and +1atk)

mazdakUprisingNotification = The Mazdaks have risen up against their oppressors!<br>The recent occupation of the Mazdak Socialist<br>Republic has lead to an outpouring of support from<br>Mazdak communities around the globe in the form of<br>volunteers and weapons. This kind of windfall will<br>only happen once, so try not to lose control of the<br>homeland again!

worldConquestNotification = At last, the holy city of Arcadia is within our possession<br>and the final renovation of the world is at hand! Mazdaks<br>from all over the Earth flock to our banner and cast off<br>the shackles of oppression in their homelands. To war!<br><br>(We are now at war with everyone)

giantEnemyCrabNotification = Our scientific prowess knows no bounds, and finally the<br>culmination of all our knowledge has been unleashed! The<br>Emperor's secret project is complete, the Giant Crab! The<br>very earth itself trembles at the might of this terrible<br>creature, and soon all of humanity shall fear it too!<br><br>(This is an easter egg, provided to Korea upon researching<br>every technology. It is a reference to some previous game<br>that I produced. If you do not want it, use Edit Mode to<br>remove the crab from the map. The crab has 6x6atk, 6x6def,<br>6mov, 6hp, and spawns 3 crablings per turn.)
